## Talks

We want to encourage students and postdocs to present their work. As they may prefer shorter talks (10 minutes), there will be a mix of 10 and 25 minute talks.  There will also be a lightning talk session of 8-10 short talks that are each 5 minutes. These can work well when describing a resource, software package or a project that has just begun. Please [submit an abstract](http://bit.ly/abstractVIBE) if you wish to present a talk. 

## Posters 

We can accommodate posters, but please [submit an abstract](http://bit.ly/abstractVIBE) so we can reserve poster boards.  The Poster Size: A1 portrait (Preferred) A1 landscape or A0 portrait (acceptable). Please keep flat if possible.
